# Overview

Building Cleaning Assignments is a web app that displays the cleaning assignements for a building by family.

My purpose in writing this software is to facilitate the process of organizing volunteers to clean a building. It does this by displaying the assignments and all other needed information in a convenient format.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
